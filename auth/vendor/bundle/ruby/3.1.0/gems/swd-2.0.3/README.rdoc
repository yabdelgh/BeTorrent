SWD (Simple Web Discovery) Client Library

NOTE:
SWD was designed to be the core of OpenID Connect Discovery, but it's replaced with WebFinger.
So I'm no longer supporting this gem.

== Installation

  gem install swd

== Resources

* View Source on GitHub (https://github.com/nov/swd)
* Report Issues on GitHub (https://github.com/nov/swd/issues)

== Examples

  begin
    res = SWD.discover!(
      :principal => 'nov@matake.jp',
      :service => 'http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer',
      :host => 'openid-connect.herokuapp.com'
    ) # => SWD::Response
    puts res.location, res.locations, res.raw
  rescue SWD::HttpError => e
    puts "#{e.status} #{e.message}"
  rescue SWD::Exception => e
    puts e.message
  end

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
